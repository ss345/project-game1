# Security Guide for Deployment

## 1. HTTPS Requirement
To ensure high security, this application **MUST** be served over HTTPS.
HTTPS encrypts the communication between the user's browser and the server, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.

- **Hosting Providers**: Most modern static site hosts (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting) provide HTTPS automatically.
- **Self-Hosting**: If hosting on your own server (Nginx, Apache), use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to obtain a free SSL certificate.

## 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
We have implemented a strict CSP in [index.html](file:///Users/SSS/.gemini/antigravity/brain/46791868-e271-4aaa-aa5e-ec0ad1d797a7/index.html):
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:;">
```
- **script-src 'self'**: Prevents loading scripts from unauthorized external servers (mitigates XSS).
- **style-src 'unsafe-inline'**: Allowed for dynamic JavaScript styling adjustments (e.g., animations). 

## 3. Game Integrity (Anti-Cheat Limitations)
**Important**: This is a pure Client-Side application.
- All game logic (Hit detection, Medal count, Boss HP) runs in the user's browser.
- A technical user **CAN** modify these values using browser Developer Tools.
- **Mitigation**: To prevent cheating effectively, the game logic must be moved to a secure server (Server-Authoritative Architecture). This requires a backend database and API, which is outside the scope of this static web app.

## 4. Best Practices
- Keep your server or hosting platform up to date.
- Do not add unknown third-party scripts (analytics, ads) without auditing them and updating the CSP.
