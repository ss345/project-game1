# Oreca Medal Web - Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Create a web-based game inspired by "Monster Retsuden Oreca Battle 2: Pandora's Medal".
The game will be a **Medal Shooting RPG**.
Players use medals as ammo to shoot scrolling targets and battle boss monsters.
It will feature "Oreca" elements like Monster Summoning (deck selection) and EX Attacks (triggered by gauge).

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The game is a "Medal Shooting" game, not the turn-based command battle of the original Oreca Battle RPG.
> Controls will be optimized for Touch (Mobile/Tablet) and Mouse (PC).
